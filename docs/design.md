# tempo-tb-ingest — Design Document (v1)

*Draft 2026-07-08 — for review. Companion to `docs/feasibility.md` (validated protocol
facts, use case, radio options, validation history). Where this document states a
protocol fact without citation, the feasibility study is the source.*

## 1. Purpose and scope

`tempo-tb-ingest` is an always-on ingestion service for a dropzone workstation. It
detects Tempo-BT devices returning from a jump via their BLE advertisements, harvests
new logging sessions over SMP, verifies and stages them for `tempo-testbed`, and
publishes everything it does as a structured real-time event stream. A browser-based
full-screen dashboard subscribes to that stream as a visual demonstration of the
system.

In scope for v1:

- The ingestion daemon (scanner, return detector, harvest pipeline, session index,
  event bus + HTTP/WS API, systemd deployment) — **implemented first**.
- The `promote` command (staging → `test-data/` analysis cases): semi-automated —
  formation grouping from log timestamps/GPS, jumper attribution from the
  user-maintained `device-owners.json` registry (§3.12), propose-and-confirm.
- The dashboard application shell and its data contract — **implemented second**;
  visual/creative design is specified separately (forthcoming document) and consumes
  the contract defined here in §6.

Out of scope for v1: multi-adapter pools (designed for, not built), firmware changes,
device provisioning UI, deletion of sessions from devices.

One process, one asyncio loop, no threads except SQLite's short synchronous calls.
The daemon is the single owner of BLE interactions on its configured adapters
(adapter contention is real; see feasibility §risks).

```

Two seams make the system testable without radios (V&V requirement, CLAUDE.md):

- **`TempoDeviceLink`** — everything the harvest worker needs from a device:
  `connect() / session_list() / download(path, offset, sink) / storage_info() /
  disconnect()`. `smp_link.py` is the real implementation; `fake_link.py` serves
  scripted sessions from local fixture files, with configurable latency, throughput,
  and fault injection (mid-transfer disconnects, truncated lists).
- **`AdvertisementSource`** — the scanner emits a plain async iterator of
  `(mac, name, rssi, uuids, timestamp)` tuples. Tests substitute a scripted source;
  the presence/return logic never imports bleak.

### 3.2 Scanner (`scanner.py`)

- `BleakScanner` with a detection callback on the configured scan adapter
  (`adapter.scan`, default `hci0`), filtered to the SMP service UUID
  (`8D53DC1D-…`) with a `Tempo-BT*` name check as corroboration.
- Emits raw sightings onto the advertisement stream; no policy here.
- Restart-on-failure: if BlueZ discovery dies (D-Bus error, adapter reset), back off
  (1 s → 30 s cap), re-create the scanner, emit `scanner.degraded` /
  `scanner.recovered` events. The daemon never exits because scanning broke.
- Single-adapter mode (v1): the harvest worker holds a `radio` asyncio lock; the
  scanner is stopped while a connection is active and restarted after (BlueZ would
  pause it anyway; doing it explicitly makes state visible and evented).

### 3.3 Device identity

The BLE MAC address is **randomly assigned at power-on** (firmware sets neither
`CONFIG_BT_PRIVACY` nor `CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS`): it is stable for the duration of a
power-on session (no RPA rotation) but must never be used as a persistent
identifier. (Observed addresses have repeated across reboots in practice; the design
must not rely on that.)

- **Canonical device identity = the four-character suffix of the device name**:
  `Tempo-BT-0001` → device id `0001`. Parse rule: `^Tempo-BT-(....)$`. Suffix
  uniqueness across the fleet is a provisioning discipline; the daemon detects
  violations (same id sighted at two addresses simultaneously) and emits
  `device.identity_conflict`.
- **MAC is a transient correlator**: it links sightings within a power-on session
  and is what bleak connects to. Harvest jobs target a device id and resolve it to
  the *most recently sighted* address at connect time.
- **Names arrive in the scan response**, so discovery must use **active scanning**
  (BlueZ/bleak default). A sighting is not attributable to a device id until its
  name is known; unnamed sightings are held un-attributed and do not drive state.
- **Legacy/unprovisioned devices advertising bare `Tempo-BT` (no suffix) are
  rejected for processing** — no presence tracking toward harvest, no downloads —
  until the device is assigned a permanent suffixed name. They are surfaced to the
  operator via `device.provisioning_needed` (and the dashboard) so the condition is
  visible, never silent.

### 3.4 Presence and return detection (`presence.py`)

Per-device state machine, keyed by **device id** (suffix):

```
                 seen                          absence ≥ absent_after (10 min)
   UNKNOWN ────────────► PRESENT ◄──────────┐      (evaluated lazily on next
      │                     │               │       sighting or periodic sweep)
      │ seen             not seen for       │
      │ (never seen      lost_after (90 s)  │ seen again within absent_after
      ▼  before)            ▼               │
   RETURNED ◄──────────── AWAY ─────────────┘
      │                     └── seen after ≥ absent_after ──► RETURNED
      ▼
   (harvest queued; on completion → PRESENT, quiescent until next AWAY cycle)
```

- `lost_after` (default 90 s): advertisement gap that moves PRESENT → AWAY. Long
  enough that normal advertising jitter and scan duty cycles don't flap it.
- `absent_after` (default 10 min): AWAY duration that makes the next sighting a
  RETURNED event. A first-ever sighting is also RETURNED (unknown backlog).
- **Hysteresis**: RSSI floor (default −75 dBm, config) applies to *sightings used for
  state transitions*; sub-floor sightings still update a `last_heard_weak` field for
  dashboard display but don't change state. A device that completed a harvest is
  quiescent: further sightings keep it PRESENT; only a full AWAY→RETURNED cycle (or
  operator CLI `--force`) re-queues it.
- All transitions emit events (§6.2).

Rationale: the firmware is radio-silent while logging, so AWAY→RETURNED closely
tracks "jump completed" even if the jumper never physically leaves range.

### 3.5 Harvest pipeline (`harvest.py`)

A FIFO queue of harvest jobs (one per RETURNED device; duplicates coalesce). Worker
count = number of transfer adapters (v1: one). Job state machine — every transition
evented:

```
QUEUED → CONNECTING → ENUMERATING → DOWNLOADING (per session file)
       → VERIFYING → STORING → DONE
any state → FAILED (categorized; retry policy below)
```

Per job:

1. **Connect** via `TempoDeviceLink` (holds the radio lock in single-adapter mode).
   Connect timeout 20 s.
2. **Enumerate**: `SESSION_LIST` (group 64) → full session keys
   `<YYYYMMDD>/<8HEX>`. If `truncated: true`, emit `harvest.truncated` (warning
   severity — the operator must eventually archive the card; feasibility risk #1).
3. **Diff** against the SQLite index → list of unknown session keys.
4. **Download** each unknown session's `/SD:/logs/<key>/flight.txt` (path by
   convention) to a `.part` file in a spool directory, emitting throttled
   `transfer.progress` events (≤ 5 Hz). SMP `fs download` is offset-based:
   a pre-existing `.part` resumes from its byte length.
5. **Verify**: final size matches the `len` reported by the fs download protocol;
   compute SHA-256. Zero-byte or short files are failures, never stored.
6. **Store**: atomic rename into
   `<staging_root>/<DeviceFolder>/logs/<key>/flight.txt` (same-filesystem spool →
   rename is atomic). Record in index **with harvest-time jumper attribution**: the
   ownership registry (§3.12) is consulted at this moment — minutes after the jump,
   when the device→jumper mapping is freshest — and the binding (jumper name +
   load-organizer flag) is stored with the session. Emit `store.session_added`.
7. **Disconnect**, mark job DONE with summary stats.

**Failure policy.** Connection or mid-transfer failures (device left range, device
started logging and dropped BLE) leave `.part` files in place and schedule a retry:
the device's presence state returns to PRESENT-unharvested, and the *next sighting*
re-queues the job (no blind timer-based retries against an absent device); at most
`max_attempts` (default 5) per AWAY→RETURNED cycle, exponential backoff between
attempts while the device remains visible. All failures are loud, categorized events
— **no silent fallbacks, no mock data** (CLAUDE.md).

Never send `LOGGER_CONTROL` (or any group-64 write) during harvest: v1 harvesting is
strictly read-only against the device.

**Device folder naming.** Derived from the device id: `TempoBT-<id>` (existing
convention in `tempo-testbed/device-data/`, e.g. id `0001` → `TempoBT-0001`).
Suffix-less `Tempo-BT` devices are rejected for processing per §3.3 — they are never
queued, so no folder question arises.

### 3.6 Session index and staging store (`store.py`)

SQLite (stdlib, WAL mode) at `<data_dir>/ingest.db`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE devices (
  device_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,    -- canonical identity: 4-char name suffix ("0001")
  name TEXT,                     -- last seen full BLE name
  folder TEXT,                   -- staging folder name ("TempoBT-0001")
  last_mac TEXT,                 -- most recent power-on-session address (transient)
  first_seen TEXT, last_seen TEXT,
  notes TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  device_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  session_key TEXT NOT NULL,     -- "<YYYYMMDD>/<8HEX>"
  size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  sha256 TEXT NOT NULL,
  downloaded_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  path TEXT NOT NULL,            -- staged file path
  jumper TEXT,                   -- harvest-time attribution (§3.12); NULL = unmapped
  jumper_is_lo INTEGER DEFAULT 0,-- jumper was load organizer at harvest time
  promoted_to TEXT,              -- test-data case/jumper, once promoted
  PRIMARY KEY (device_id, session_key)
);
CREATE INDEX sessions_sha ON sessions(sha256);  -- cross-device dedup check (warn-only)
```

The staging tree remains the human-browsable source of truth for file *content*; the
DB is the daemon's memory of what it has (diffing, dedup, promote bookkeeping). A
`rebuild-index` maintenance command reconstructs the DB by walking the staging tree
(hashes recomputed), so the DB is always disposable.

### 3.7 Event bus and API (`events.py`, `api.py`)

In-process pub/sub: components `publish(event)`; subscribers (WS sessions, recorder,
log writer) consume via bounded asyncio queues (slow consumers drop-oldest and
receive a `stream.gap` marker — the daemon never blocks on a viewer).

aiohttp application on `http.listen` (default `127.0.0.1:8080`; LAN exposure is a
config decision):

- `GET /state` — full snapshot (§6.1), including `seq` of the last event applied
  (polling/diagnostics).
- `GET /events` (WebSocket) — **the first frame is a snapshot**
  (`{"kind":"snapshot","state":{…}}`), taken after the server subscribes to the
  bus, followed by `{"kind":"event","event":{…}}` frames with `seq >` the
  snapshot's — so the snapshot/stream gap race is structurally impossible
  (amended 2026-07-08 from the original fetch-then-connect protocol, which was
  racy). On WS drop: reconnect; the fresh snapshot re-anchors (no server-side
  backfill in v1).
- `GET /healthz` — liveness for systemd watchdog / monitoring.
- `GET /` + static assets — the built dashboard (`dashboard/dist/`).

Read-only in v1: no control endpoints. (The bus design permits adding an
operator-command channel later — e.g. LED-blink identify — without rework.)

### 3.8 Recorder and replay (`recorder.py`)

- **Record**: every event (envelope included) appended to
  `<data_dir>/events/YYYYMMDD.jsonl`. Rotation daily; these files are the raw
  material for dashboard development, demos, regression fixtures, and field
  diagnosis.
- **Replay**: `tempo-tb-ingest replay <file.jsonl> [--speed 10] [--loop]` starts the
  API server fed from the file instead of live components — the dashboard cannot
  tell the difference. This is a first-class deliverable, not a test hack: it is how
  the dashboard is developed and demoed without hardware.

### 3.9 Configuration (`config.py`)

TOML at `/etc/tempo-tb-ingest.toml` or `--config`; env-var overrides
(`TEMPO_INGEST_*`) for containers/tests. Complete v1 surface:

```toml
[adapter]
scan = "hci0"            # scanning adapter
transfer = ["hci0"]      # transfer adapter pool (v1: same, single)

[detection]
rssi_floor_dbm = -75
lost_after_s = 90
absent_after_s = 600

[harvest]
connect_timeout_s = 20
max_attempts = 5
spool_dir = "/var/lib/tempo-tb-ingest/spool"

[store]
staging_root = "/home/riley/src/tempo-testbed/device-data"
data_dir = "/var/lib/tempo-tb-ingest"
# ownership registry is <staging_root>/device-owners.json (§3.12); override:
# owners_file = "..."

[promote]
test_data_root = "/home/riley/src/tempo-testbed/test-data"
exit_window_s = 120              # formation grouping window (§3.11)
gps_max_separation_m = 500      # freefall proximity cross-check

[dropzone]                       # copied verbatim into generated metadata.json
name = "Texoma (North TX)"
lat_deg = 33.4569
lon_deg = -96.3770
elevation_m = 233.0
timezone = "America/Chicago"

[http]
listen = "127.0.0.1:8080"

[log]
level = "info"           # structured JSON logs to stdout (journald)
```

### 3.10 Process management

systemd unit: `Restart=on-failure`, `WatchdogSec` fed from the main loop via
`sd_notify`, journald for logs, `After=bluetooth.service`. Single-instance enforcement
via a lock on `data_dir` (two daemons on one adapter is a known failure mode).
Graceful shutdown: finish or cleanly abort the in-flight transfer (leaving `.part`),
emit `daemon.stopping`, close WS sessions.

### 3.11 `promote` command (`promote.py`)

Semi-automated, **propose-and-confirm**: the command computes a complete promotion
proposal, displays it, and applies it only on operator confirmation (`--yes` skips
confirmation for scripting; individual proposals can be edited or excluded before
applying).

1. **Enrich** staged sessions where `promoted_to IS NULL`: jump date, exit UTC,
   duration, landing coordinates (Python port of
   `tempo-testbed/scripts/flight-info.sh` parsing: first `$GNRMC` date, `$GNGGA`
   extents, `$PST JUMPED` + `$PTH`/GGA clock alignment, sub-0.8 g fallback).
   Sessions with no detected exit are listed but not auto-grouped (candidate ground
   tests / non-jumps — operator decides).
2. **Group into formations**: sessions whose exit UTC fall within a configurable
   window (`exit_window_s`, default 120 s) form a candidate formation; a GPS
   cross-check (horizontal separation during freefall below a threshold) confirms
   membership and can split coincidental same-window groups. Singleton groups are
   solo jumps. Ambiguities (window overlap, GPS disagreement) are flagged in the
   proposal, never silently resolved.
3. **Build case proposals** per group, in the existing `test-data` conventions:
   - Case dir: next sequential number + generated slug —
     `NN-formation-YYYYMMDD-<k>way` / `NN-solo-<jumper>-YYYYMMDD`.
   - One subdir per jumper, named from the session's **harvest-time attribution**
     (§3.12); `flight.txt` copied in.
   - `metadata.json` generated per the `test-data/README.md` schema: `jumpers[]`;
     `baseJumper` = the group member whose `jumper_is_lo` is set (the load
     organizer is the default formation base) — if no LO is in the group, the
     proposal flags it and defaults to the first jumper pending operator edit; if
     more than one, flagged likewise; `isSolo`; `dropzone` block verbatim from the
     `[dropzone]` config section; `name`/`description` auto-composed with exit UTC
     and session hash IDs (matching the style of existing cases); `tags` seeded
     (`formation`/`solo`, `<k>way`, date).
   - Sessions with `jumper IS NULL` (unmapped at harvest) are excluded from
     grouping and listed prominently — fix `device-owners.json`, re-attribute
     (`promote --reattribute` re-reads the registry for still-unpromoted
     sessions), and re-run.
4. **Apply** on confirmation: copies only — staging remains intact; `promoted_to`
   recorded per session; re-running never duplicates an applied case.

### 3.12 Device ownership registry (`device-owners.json`)

The one piece of jump context that logs cannot provide: **who was wearing each
device, and who organized the load**. User-maintained (edited at the start of a jump
day or whenever a device changes hands), located at
`<staging_root>/device-owners.json` — alongside the data it describes:

```json
[
  { "deviceName": "Tempo-BT-0001", "jumperName": "riley", "isLoadOrganizer": true },
  { "deviceName": "Tempo-BT-0002", "jumperName": "russ" },
  { "deviceName": "Tempo-BT-0003", "jumperName": "divyatej_dt" }
]
```

- Fields: `deviceName` (full BLE name; matched by its 4-char suffix = device id),
  `jumperName` (must be a valid `test-data` jumper-directory name), and optional
  `isLoadOrganizer` (default `false`). The load organizer is the default formation
  base for analysis.
- **The daemon hot-reloads the file** (mtime check) before each harvest's store
  step; the binding is recorded per session at harvest time (§3.5) — attribution
  reflects who had the device *that day*, not whenever promotion happens to run.
- Same jumper on multiple devices is legal (e.g. test rigs). Duplicate
  `deviceName` entries, unparseable JSON, or invalid names are a **loud**
  `owners.error` event; the daemon keeps using the last good copy (never guesses,
  never blocks harvesting — files are stored with `jumper = NULL` only if the
  device has no valid entry).
- A harvested device with no registry entry is stored unattributed
  (`jumper = NULL`) and surfaced via `owners.unmapped` — visible on the dashboard,
  fixable later via `promote --reattribute`.

## 4. Verification & Validation plan

Test tiers (pytest + pytest-asyncio; `ruff` + `mypy --strict` as static gates):

| Tier | Marker | Needs | Verifies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | (default) | nothing | presence state machine (time-warped clock), session diffing, folder mapping, event schemas, config parsing, index ops, flight-info parsing against fixture logs |
| Integration | (default) | nothing | scanner→detector→harvest→store end-to-end over `fake_link` + scripted advertisements, incl. fault injection: mid-transfer drop + resume, truncated session list, zero-byte file, duplicate hash, WS snapshot/stream coherence |
| Replay | (default) | recorded JSONL fixtures | event-stream compatibility (a schema change that breaks stored recordings fails CI), dashboard data contract |
| Live read-only | `-m live` | any Tempo-BT in range | discovery, session-list, one real download, SHA-256 match against a reference copy |
| Live destructive | `-m destructive` | dev device + **`testok`-marked SD card** | interrupted-transfer resume against a real radio drop, re-harvest after card reimage, (future) session-delete paths |

**`testok` protocol** (CLAUDE.md constraint): destructive-tier setup probes the card
for the root marker **file** `/SD:/testok` over SMP before anything else and
hard-fails the tier if absent. Probe = SMP fs `STATUS` (`smpmgr file read-size`;
`ReadFileSize` in smpclient) — verified live 2026-07-08 against firmware v1.5.0:
existing file → success + size; directory → `FS_MGMT_ERR_FILE_IS_DIRECTORY` (4);
missing → `FS_MGMT_ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` (3). A file marker is used because presence
maps to plain success (a directory would also be detectable via the distinct rc=4,
but interpreting error codes as "present" is needlessly subtle). The file may be
empty or carry a one-line card label. Local SD-card mounts check trivially either
way.

**Validation** (distinct from verification): before each field deployment, a scripted
end-to-end run against a live device — walk-away/return cycle, auto-harvest, SHA-256
byte-verification against a manual SD copy — with results appended to the validation
history in `docs/feasibility.md` style. Acceptance criterion is byte-identity, always.

Coverage isn't worshipped, but the presence state machine, harvest job state machine,
and event schema code must be effectively fully covered — they are the system's logic
core and are all testable without hardware.

## 5. Error handling summary

| Condition | Behavior | Event |
|---|---|---|
| Adapter/BlueZ failure | backoff + rebuild scanner; daemon stays up | `scanner.degraded/recovered` |
| Connect timeout | retry policy §3.5 | `harvest.failed(reason=connect)` |
| Mid-transfer disconnect | keep `.part`; resume on next attempt at byte offset | `transfer.failed(resumable=true)` |
| Device starts logging mid-harvest | same as disconnect (device drops BLE) | same |
| `truncated: true` in session list | harvest what's listed; persistent warning state until cleared | `harvest.truncated` |
| Short/zero-byte download | never stored; that session skipped loudly, the rest of the harvest proceeds (real case: a 0-byte `19700101/...` GPS-less boot artifact observed on 0001's card) | `store.error` |
| Duplicate SHA-256, different session key | store anyway; warn (possible card clone) | `store.duplicate_hash` |
| Unprovisioned name `Tempo-BT` (no suffix) | rejected for processing until renamed; surfaced for operator | `device.provisioning_needed` |
| Same device id at two addresses simultaneously | both blocked from harvest until resolved; loud warning | `device.identity_conflict` |
| `device-owners.json` invalid/unparseable | keep last good copy; harvest continues | `owners.error` |
| Harvested device absent from registry | stored with `jumper = NULL`; fixable via `promote --reattribute` | `owners.unmapped` |
| Formation grouping ambiguity (window overlap / GPS disagreement) | flagged in promote proposal; operator resolves | *(promote output, not an event)* |
| Staging disk full / unwritable | job FAILED loudly; daemon keeps scanning | `store.error` |

No error path substitutes fabricated data or silently succeeds.

## 6. Daemon ↔ dashboard contract

This is the interface the dashboard (and its forthcoming visual-design document)
builds against. JSON throughout; all timestamps ISO-8601 UTC; `v: 1` schema version
in both snapshot and envelope. Additive changes only within v1; removals/renames bump
`v`.

### 6.1 Snapshot — `GET /state`

```json

  "v": 1, "seq": 8231, "ts": "2026-07-08T17:03:22.114Z",

    "mac": "DC:BD:F1:0D:F1:D9", "jumper": "riley", "is_lo": true,
    "state": "PRESENT", "rssi": -58, "last_seen": "…", "away_since": null,
    "sessions_known": 26, "provisioning_needed": false, "truncated": false
  }],
  "queue": [ { "id": "…", "queued_at": "…" } ],
  "active_job": {
    "id": "…", "state": "DOWNLOADING",
    "session_key": "20260708/1A2B3C4D", "file_index": 2, "file_total": 3,
    "bytes_done": 1310720, "bytes_total": 2875691, "rate_bps": 43000
  },
  "totals": { "sessions_stored": 29, "bytes_stored": 88342511, "harvests_completed": 7, "failures": 1 }
}
```

`active_job` is `null` when idle; becomes a list if/when multi-adapter lands (the
dashboard should treat it as `0..n`).

`id` is the canonical device key throughout (§3.3); `mac` is informational — the
current power-on-session address — and may change between appearances of the same
`id`. Unprovisioned devices (bare `Tempo-BT`) appear in `devices` with `"id": null`,
`provisioning_needed: true`, and their transient `mac`, so the dashboard can show
them without the daemon ever processing them.

### 6.2 Event envelope and vocabulary — `WS /events`

```json
{ "v": 1, "seq": 8232, "ts": "2026-07-08T17:03:22.514Z",
  "type": "transfer.progress", "data": { … } }
```

`seq` is a per-daemon-run monotonic counter (resets on restart; a `daemon.started`
event signals clients to re-snapshot).

| Type | Key `data` fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `daemon.started` / `daemon.stopping` | version, config echo | clients re-snapshot on `started` |
| `scanner.degraded` / `scanner.recovered` | reason | |
| `device.seen` | id, mac, name, rssi | throttled ≤ 1/s per device |
| `device.new` | id, mac, name, rssi | first sighting ever |
| `device.away` | id, away_since | PRESENT→AWAY |
| `device.returned` | id, absent_for_s | triggers queue |
| `device.lost` | id | pruned after prolonged absence (display only) |
| `device.provisioning_needed` | mac, name | bare `Tempo-BT` (no id); rejected for processing |
| `device.identity_conflict` | id, macs | same id at two addresses simultaneously (duplicate suffix in fleet) |
| `harvest.queued` / `harvest.started` | id, attempt | |
| `harvest.session_list` | id, count, new_count, truncated | |
| `harvest.truncated` | id | sticky warning |
| `transfer.started` | id, session_key, file_index, file_total, resumed_from | |
| `transfer.progress` | id, session_key, bytes_done, bytes_total, rate_bps | throttled ≤ 5 Hz |
| `transfer.completed` | id, session_key, bytes, sha256, duration_s | |
| `transfer.failed` | id, session_key, reason, resumable | |
| `store.session_added` | id, session_key, path, size, sha256, jumper | jumper `null` if unmapped |
| `store.duplicate_hash` / `store.error` | details | |
| `owners.reloaded` | entries, path | registry hot-reload (§3.12) |
| `owners.error` | reason, path | invalid registry; last good copy in use |
| `owners.unmapped` | id, name | harvested device with no registry entry |
| `harvest.completed` | id, sessions_downloaded, bytes, duration_s | |
| `harvest.failed` | id, reason, attempt, will_retry | |
| `stream.gap` | dropped_count | slow-consumer marker; client should re-snapshot |

This vocabulary is intentionally rich enough to animate the full walk-in-the-door
story: appearance → return detection → connection → per-file progress → verified
storage.

## 7. Dashboard (architectural spec; visuals deferred)

- **Form**: static SPA (Vite + React + TypeScript; D3/SVG for bespoke graphics),
  built to `dashboard/dist/`, served by the daemon; zero runtime dependencies beyond
  the daemon. Runs full-screen in Chromium `--kiosk` on the workstation; any other
  browser on the LAN may view simultaneously (multi-viewer is free).
- **Behavior**: snapshot-then-stream client per §6; read-only; auto-reconnect with
  re-snapshot; visible "stale" indicator if the stream drops (never silently
  frozen).
- **Dev/demo mode**: runs identically against `replay` (§3.8) — the visual design
  work needs no hardware present.
- **Content** (minimum, pending the visual-design document): device roster with
  presence states and RSSI, the return/harvest activity as animated interactions
  between device and host, active transfer progress with rates, recent-harvest feed,
  totals, and sticky warnings (`truncated`, provisioning-needed, scanner degraded).

## 8. Dependencies

Runtime: `smpclient` (SMP + BLE via bleak), `bleak`, `aiohttp`, `typer`, `pydantic`
(event/config models), stdlib `sqlite3`. Dev: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `ruff`,
`mypy`. Python ≥ 3.12; packaged with `pyproject.toml` (`uv` for dev environments,
plain `pip` install supported). Group-64 message classes are ported from
`tempo-insights/smpmgr-extensions/plugins/tempo_group.py` into
`device/tempo_group.py` (single source going forward; the smpmgr plugin remains the
manual diagnostic harness).

## 9. Milestones

Each milestone has explicit verification before the next begins (V&V approach).

| # | Deliverable | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Package scaffold, config, event bus, structured logging, CI-able test run | unit tests green; `--help` works |
| M1 | `device/` protocol client: session-list, download with resume, group-64 port | integration vs `fake_link` incl. fault injection; **live read-only tier vs Tempo-BT-0001: SHA-256 match** |
| M2 | Scanner + presence/return detection | unit (time-warped) + scripted-advertisement integration; bench test with real device power-cycled/carried away |
| M3 | Harvest pipeline + store + index | end-to-end vs fake; **live destructive tier vs dev device + `testok` card** (interrupted resume) |
| M4 | API (`/state`, `/events`), recorder, replay | WS contract tests; recorded live session replays cleanly |
| M5 | systemd deployment; field trial at dropzone | validation run appended to feasibility doc; threshold tuning notes |
| M6 | Dashboard v1 per visual-design doc | replay-driven demo; kiosk soak test |

## 10. Open questions (carried into implementation)

1. ~~`testok` probe mechanics over SMP~~ — **resolved 2026-07-08** (§4): marker is a
   root *file* `/SD:/testok`, probed with the stock fs STATUS command; all three
   response classes verified on live firmware.
2. Exact `fs download` failure semantics in `smpclient` on radio drop (exception
   surface, partial-sink state) — characterize at M1, encode in `fake_link` faults.
3. ~~Whether BlueZ requires explicit scanner stop during connect~~ — **resolved
   2026-07-08, live**: it does (`org.bluez.Error.InProgress` on every connect
   attempt while discovery ran). The harvest worker's radio gate pauses the
   scanner for the duration of each connection (`ScannerPausingRadioGate`);
   pause/resume is not an outage and emits no degraded/recovered events.
4. Unprovisioned-device operator flow (currently: surface only) — revisit after
   field trial.
5. Formation-grouping GPS cross-check metric (§3.11): exact definition (separation
   at exit vs. mean during freefall) and the `gps_max_separation_m` default — settle
   empirically against the existing multi-device logs in `device-data/` (three
   devices, same formations, ground truth known) during the promote implementation
   step.
6. Dashboard visual design — forthcoming document (owner: Riley).
